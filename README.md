###### beta v0.1.2

A set of useful SCSS mixins to supercharge your workflow, with no development dependencies. The package avoids redundant prefixing mixins. Instead, we'd let ```autoprefixer``` take care of that for us while compiling CSS stylesheet document.

_Note: This package is still under development phase, refrain using for production purposes until v1.0.0 is rolled out_
